# My Awesome NotePad
 Hi, This is the notepad I created using python..
 I used a module called PyQt5, You may or may not know this module..
 
 You can take all the png files fro this repository, Because you need it without this the program won't work..
 
 You can even import your own png files and change the names of the files in the code..
 
 There is no compicated process here.. Just mostly using the module and using objects like classses and functions
